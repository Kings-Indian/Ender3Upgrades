# 6/27/2025 â€” Screen Mount and LED Rail Redesign

Slide for LEDSâ€”wasn't sure how to fix at first. After brainstorming, I realized **neodymium magnets** could provide a sleek, clean, and removable attachment system.

For the screen, I couldnâ€™t find the exact model online. I based my design on this similar model:  
[Waveshare 4.3" HDMI LCD-B](https://www.waveshare.com/4.3inch-HDMI-LCD-B.htm)  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7ad5964-fbdf-43c8-bb91-b195f933497e)

Added a **10mm margin** on all sides, with a cutout on the right and top for cable clearance:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61ea1794-9dbd-473c-90fe-ebcfc4da5365)

To enclose the top, I refined the model to match the screenâ€™s plane:

After applying **fillets to all edges**, final design complete:
