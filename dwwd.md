# Raspberry Pi Magnetic PETG Case

**Total time spent: 21h**

## Goal
Design and print a custom **PETG case for my Ender 3** focused on cooling and modularity.  
Key features:
- Magnetic attachment for easy assembly
- Dual 30mm fans (perfect match for the 30mm × 65mm Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W)
- LED support with WS2812B strips
- Modular screen mount

# June 25th: Initial Layout and Planning

Started the design process by planning the overall layout for the Raspberry Pi case. The goal was to create a magnetic PETG case that would fit perfectly on my Ender 3 with dual fan cooling.

This setup allows this layout:

![Layout](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7193a171-dd17-445b-868b-73dc5ac8ab1e)

Designed the fan case conforming with this layout:

# June 27th: Screen Mount and LED Rail Redesign

Had some issues with the LED slide design initially. After brainstorming, I realized **neodymium magnets** could provide a sleek, clean, and removable attachment system for the LED strips.

For the screen, I couldn’t find the exact model online. I based my design on this similar model. While I am using 
[Waveshare 4.3" HDMI LCD-B](https://www.waveshare.com/4.3inch-HDMI-LCD-B.htm), the model is of https://www.waveshare.com/4.3inch-dsi-lcd.htm

Added a **10mm margin** on all sides, with a cutout on the right and top for cable clearance:

To enclose the top, I refined the model to match the screen’s plane:

After applying **fillets to all edges**, final design complete:
